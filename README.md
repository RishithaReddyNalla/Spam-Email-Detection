# Spam Email Detection

A machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

Spam emails are a common nuisance and a major security concern. This project leverages machine learning techniques to accurately detect spam emails based on their content.

## Features

- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Classification using models like Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / SVM
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Optional GUI or web-based prediction interface

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit / Flask (for optional frontend)

## Dataset

The dataset used is the SpamAssassin dataset / UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
